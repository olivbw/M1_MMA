Project carried out as part of a Python programming course during my Master's degree. This project topic was proposed by Madame Julie Delon (MAP5 & UMR CNRS 8145).

Using Python, a database is accessed using the pandas module, containing for each country in the world the coordinates of its geographical boundaries as well as information on the number of islands it contains, for example.

Another database is also used, containing the geographical coordinates of the capital of each country, which allows it to be displayed on the map as well.

The goal was then to display the outlines of a random country to the player, with a rotation on the map to increase the difficulty, and gradually make them guess the name of the country in question using hints.
