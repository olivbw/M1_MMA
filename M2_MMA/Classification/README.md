Project proposed by Mr. [Olivier Bouaziz](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~obouaziz/) (MAP5 & Department STID, IUT de Paris) as part of the Classification UE of the M2 MMA.

First exercise: The aim is to implement the LDA method using the results from the course (without using the lda function from the MASS package) and to study its performance on simulated data. Then compare the results obtained with the manual implementation and those obtained with the lda function.

Second exercise: We are interested in predicting diabetes in women based on several clinical variables. The data is found in the diabetes.csv table. The variable to predict is the Outcome variable. In this dataset, the SkinThickness and Insulin variables contain missing data, coded as the value 0.
