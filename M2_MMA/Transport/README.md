Project proposed by Mrs. [Marcela Szopos](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~mszoposh/) as part of the Transport Equations UE of the M2 MMA.

Calculate the exact solution of the problem and graphically represent it using Python for different parameter values.

Proposal of a variational formulation of the problem and demonstration of the existence of a solution by applying the Lax-Milgram theorem.

Formulation of the problem into a matrix form in order to compute the coefficients of the matrix $A_h$ and the vector $b_h$ associated.

Display of the solutions and observation that the solution explodes for values of gamma that are too large; an alternative is then proposed, the Petrov-Galerkin method, which aims to choose different functional spaces for the test functions and the approximate solution.s
