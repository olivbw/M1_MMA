## Spécialité Mathématiques, Modélisation, Apprentissage

Keywords: **Learning**, **Machine Learning**, **High Dimension**, **Massive Data**, **Biostatistics**, **Optimization**, **Image Processing**, **Computer Vision**.

The Master's in **Mathematics, Modeling, and Learning** is organized based on a common first year (M1) and a second year (M2) offering various options.

The M1 MMA focuses on different aspects of applied mathematics. Its aim is to provide a solid foundational culture in analysis, probability, and statistics, while preparing students for the pathways offered in the second year.

The M2 MMA offers advanced training in the fields of probability, statistics, mathematical modeling, image processing, and the application of mathematics to life sciences, consistent with the themes of the [MAP5](https://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) laboratory.

The M1 MMA also allows students to apply for the Mathematics, Vision, and Learning (MVA) master's program, as part of a training partnership between the Université Paris Saclay and Université Paris Cité.
